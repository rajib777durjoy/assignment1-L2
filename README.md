What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
ans: we are use Interface in object , then Interface allow Extends . we are use Type then Type not allow Extends . Type allow union and Intersection .

Provide an example of using union and intersection types in TypeScript.
ans: Union means a value can be taken from any one of multiple types. and Intersection means a value must have all the properties of multiple types.
